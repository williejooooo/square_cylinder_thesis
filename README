In flow solver sample, run the following command Python3 file

python3 drag_analysis.py

Make sure you have numpy, scipy, and matplotlib libraries installed.
Have 'Force_Data.csv' in line 5 in the correct directory

The terminal will list the output variables:

Coeff of Drag Variation:  0.02639999999999998
Coeff of Lift Variation:  0.63576
Average Coeff of Lift:  0.005955117325441498
Average Coeff of Drag:  1.4705854567950987
Avg Cl rms:  0.2242778478443576
Avg Cl 0.005976722153589319
Avg Cd 1.4708025041736226

Copy and paste these terminal results to other Python files.
Var_Cf.py - Coeff of Drag Variation
          - Coeff of Lift Variation

Cd_Results.py - Average Coeff of Drag

St_Results.py - Outdated, unused. If you want to use this, output the Strouhal number where max magnitude occurs.

A output file .csv file is printed for each number:

Re_XXX_St.csv

Move this file to ../StrouhalNumber3Dplots. Once all the files for each Re are together
Run the follwing file:

python3 St_Plot_3D.py

Make sure to save output images.
